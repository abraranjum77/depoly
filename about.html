East Coast Financing was built on a belief – 
that Atlantic Canadians could have the opportunity to purchase their dream car or everyday vehicle, 
and keep the process affordable and easy... for anyone.
</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="quotes-normal">
<p>
I felt there was a real opportunity to source a spectrum of top automotive brands which are found more frequently in western Canada and make them accessible to East Coast auto financing applicants.  We proudly showcase dozens of vehicles you’d be hard pressed to find elsewhere in the Maritimes.  
I know we can find vehicles you thought we’re impossible to source and to finance.  
Tell us what you’re looking for… We can make it happen. </p>
<p>I promise a stress-free car buying experience. At East Coast Financing, we offer <a href="#">easy vehicle financing </a> and dozens of other incentives like <a href="#">cash back offers </a>and <a href="#"> referral programs </a>. Don’t let having bad or no credit stop you from buying your dream car! Honda used cars sold through us go through a rigorous 180 point screening process – they are tested to be safe and ready for the road.”

After consulting with multiple vets and spending over $6,000 in 2 days trying to save her, every vet recommended that she be put down. Daniel sought out a vet who specialized in alternative Chinese medicine and acupuncture. Karma was slowly nursed back to health over the course of 3 months. Sadly, she passed away shortly after.
